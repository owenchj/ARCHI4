# ARCHI4 (Architectures massivement multi-coeurs)

Description of the EU:
This UE presents the fundamental principles of massively multi-processor hardware architectures (several thousand cores) built around a shared address space and physically distributed memory and computing resources. 
It analyzes problems related to communications (on-chip micro-networks), synchronization (locks and atomic access), hardware mechanisms to support virtual memory, 
and techniques to ensure cache consistency. The problem of efficient deployment of applications on these architectures will also be treated and analyzed finely using the prototyping platform of the TSAR architecture.
